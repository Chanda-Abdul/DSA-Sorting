## 1. Understanding merge sort

Given the following list of numbers `21, 1, 26, 45, 29, 28, 2, 9, 16, 49, 39, 27, 43, 34, 46, 40`

- What is the resulting list that will be sorted after 3 recursive calls to mergesort?

`[21,1]`

- What is the resulting list that will be sorted after 16 recursive calls to mergesort?

`[16,49,39,27]`

- What are the first 2 lists to be merged?

- Which two lists would be merged on the 7th merge?



````
function mergeSort(array) {
  console.log('merge sort called' + array)
  if (array.length <= 1) {
    return array
  }
  
  const middle = Math.floor(array.length / 2)
  let left = array.slice(0, middle)
  let right = array.slice(middle, array.length)
  
  left = mergeSort(left)
  right = mergeSort(right)
  return merge(left, right, array) 
}

let arr1 = [21, 1, 26, 45, 29, 28, 2, 9, 16, 49, 39, 27, 43, 34, 46, 40]

console.log(mergeSort(arr1))
